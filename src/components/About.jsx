              <p>Hey my name is Greg! I'm new to this coding thing and decided to make an online portfolio to show off some of the tings I've been working on. I am a full time firefighter/Paramedic and am originally from New York City. I moved to Utah back in 2007 and haven't looked back. I love all things outdoors and can't wait to explore Utah some more.</p>
